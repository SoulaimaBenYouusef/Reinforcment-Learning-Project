Reinforcement Learning-Based Snake Game
This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be used to teach an AI to play the classic Snake game. It's a Python-based application that uses Pygame for the game interface and PyTorch for the machine learning aspects.

Project Overview
This Snake game AI is built from scratch, using principles of reinforcement learning, specifically Deep Q Learning. Over time, the AI agent learns the most effective strategies to play the game, making fewer mistakes and increasing its score.

Technologies Used
Python
Pygame: Used for creating the graphical interface for the game.
PyTorch: The Machine Learning framework used for creating and training the reinforcement learning model.
Learning Resources
